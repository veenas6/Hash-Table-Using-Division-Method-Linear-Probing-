Hash Table Implementation (Python)

📌 Overview
This Python program implements a basic hash table using open addressing with linear probing. It supports inserting, searching, deleting keys, and displaying the hash table's current state.

⚙️ Features
✅ Insert keys efficiently using a division-based hash function.
🔍 Search for keys and return their positions or indicate if not found.
🗑️ Delete keys by marking them as "DELETED" to maintain search integrity.
📊 Display the full hash table showing all stored keys and empty slots.

🏗️ Technologies Used
Language: Python 3
